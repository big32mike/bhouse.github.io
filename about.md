I'm a twenty-nine year old guy living in San Francisco, CA. I grew up on the
east coast in Herndon, VA outside of DC, and moved out to SF in 2011.

I work at [Zendesk](http://zendesk.com) as a DevOps Engineer on the
[@ZendeskOps](http://twitter.com/ZendeskOps) team keeping the service available
and speedy. It's a really fun job, solving lots of technical problems to help
provide the best Software as a Service we can. Prior to Zendesk I was working at
VeriSign running nameservers for TLDs, which was also way cool.

The rest of the time I'm into exploring the city on my bike or scooter, rock
climbing, hanging out with my english bulldog
[Winston](http://facebook.com/winston.house.5), reading technical books, and
occasional TV binges.

I have a brother in Austin, TX, a sister in Raleigh, NC, and my parents live in
a relaxing mountain home in Wintergreen, VA
