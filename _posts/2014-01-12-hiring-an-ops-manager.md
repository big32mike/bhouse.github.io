One of my favorite parts of working for a smaller company is watching the
evolution of the operations team I work on. We are a small group, and that
allows each person's participation to have a large impact. Providing quality
feedback for each other is easier as well, since the scope of work we're taking
on week to week is small enough for everyone to generally be aware of what
others are working on day to day.

As we grow, and more is asked of us as a team, I'm nervous about how scaling as
a team could go wrong. We'll naturally become efficient at maintaining things
we're experienced with, filling up the free time by working on projects to
further develop the infrastructure. The expanding environment increases
maintenance, requiring us to add more team members to keep up the rate of
progress. Eventually we'll reach a point where the amount of people and projects
erodes our level of peer awareness, fracturing into pockets of knowledge, and
ultimately less effective feedback for each other. Feedback I highly covet.

This is my fear, at least.

For these reasons I was excited when we decided to hire a manager for our
Operations team, who's focus it will be to directly manage a handful of
engineers. It is nice to have someone dedicated to seeing the bigger team
picture, offloading some of our peer engagement, but with the ability to
maintain quality feedback and direction.

Conversely I was hesitant to be adding another layer of management to a team
that, in my opinion, operates just fine as-is. If this person didn't fit the
role we were trying to fill, or had a different vision for the team, it would
certainly decrease our level of happiness, and our rate of productivity that
we're very proud of.

In a first for me, we (the engineers) were given the opportunity to interview
the candidates to be our boss, and discuss as a team whether they were right for
us. This calmed my concerns about even having the manager role created, knowing
our input would be a factor. It also enhanced my outlook on continued growth of
the team, knowing we'll have a voice in levels of hiring beyond just our peers.

All that being said, what I really want to talk about is the process of
interviewing my next boss. It was sort of a struggle to evaluate the candidates,
at least initially, as my interview experience has only involved interviewing
fellow engineers for positions as direct colleagues. Evaluating someone for a
management position required an entirely different line of preparation, and
analysis.

My initial criteria for the candidate was thrown together the night before the
first on-site interview. The list I came up with was based almost solely on
previous experiences.

## Good Qualities
* humility
* organization and efficiency (in conversations, meetings, and projects)
* natural leadership vibe
* instinctive mediation abilities, but not shy from confrontation
* fun and easy to be around

## Bad Qualities
* insecure
* indecisive
* panic under fire
* answering up vs. answering down

## Skills and Experience
* leading an Operations team of comparable size (6-10 Engineers)
* managing remote employees to keep them engaged, involved, and informed
* experience with modern software development practices
* techniques for prioritization of projects vs. interrupts
* modes of motivation
* identification and remediation of fatigue and burnout

I also really liked the job description we published for the position. It was
clear the objectives were to spend time focusing on the team and individuals.
Priorities would around fostering team communication, individual career
development, keeping everyone's work challenging and engaging without being
overloaded.

As candidate evaluation progressed, it became easier to analyze strengths and
weaknesses of each individual by comparison to others, and hone what we were
searching for. Rarely did I make it through the full list of questions I had
prepared, but the best candidates addressed everything I was looking for without
directly being asked!

Below is the list I eventually settled on, and I think it will be useful as I
interview with future bosses:

* What have you been told about the team and the opportunity?
* What will your first 90 days involve?
* What values do you look for in your team?
* How do you plan to recruit and hire for those values?
* Describe an effective experience you had leading an incident response.
* How do you promote your team's career development?
* When have you observed individual or team burnout, and how did you respond?
* How have you managed to keep remote employees involved?
* How do your team members describe you?

I'm really thrilled with the person we ended up hiring, and excited to see how
our team responds!
